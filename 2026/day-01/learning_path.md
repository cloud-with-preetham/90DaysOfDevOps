# My 90 Days DevOps Plan

## 1) My Current Level
- **Background:** [Non-IT]
- **Current Skills:** [basic Linux]
- **My Strengths:** [consistency, problem-solving,]
- **My Gaps:** [CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS hands-on, IaC, Monitoring]

---

## 2) My Understanding of DevOps
**DevOps** is a culture/mindset to collaborate with development teams and operations team. By reducing them the time to market, Automating the tasks and scaling to end users.

My focus in these 90 days is to learn **real-world DevOps**: building pipelines, deploying apps, managing infrastructure, and troubleshooting production-like issues.

---

## 3) Why I’m Learning DevOps & Cloud
I’m starting DevOps & Cloud because:
1. I want a career in a role that combines **development + infrastructure + automation**.
2. I want to build skills that are **high-demand and practical**.

---

## 4) Where I Want to Reach
In 90 days, I want to reach a level where I can confidently:
- Deploy applications on cloud using DevOps practices
- Build CI/CD pipelines and automate deployments
- Understand real troubleshooting, monitoring, and infrastructure basics

---

## 5) My 3 Goals for the Next 90 Days
1. **Deploy a production-style application** using Docker + Kubernetes with Ingress and configs.
2. **Build a complete CI/CD pipeline** (GitHub Actions/Jenkins) that tests, builds, and deploys automatically.
3. **Host the project on cloud (AWS)** using EC2/EKS basics + security best practices and documentation.

---

## 6) My 3 Core DevOps Skills I Will Build
1. **Linux + Troubleshooting:** processes, logs, permissions, networking, system debugging  
2. **CI/CD Pipelines:** Git, GitHub Actions/Jenkins, artifact builds, deployment automation  
3. **Containers & Kubernetes:** Docker, K8s deployments/services, debugging, scaling

---

## 7) Weekly Time Budget
- **Weekdays:** ~[3 to 4] hours/day (Mon–Fri)
- **Weekends:** ~[4 to 6] hours/day (Sat–Sun)
- **Total Weekly Commitment:** ~[30-32] hours/week

Minimum rule: **Even on busy days, I will do at least 30 minutes**.

---

## 8) How I Will Stay Consistent Every Day
- I will study at: **09.00 AM to 01.00 PM**
- Daily structure:
  - **30% learning** (concepts + notes)
  - **70% hands-on practice** (terminal + labs + mini tasks)
- I will track progress using:
  - GitHub commits
  - A simple checklist in notes
- If I miss a day, I will **not quit** — I will recover the next day with **1 extra hour**, not burnout.

---

## 9) My Execution Rules
- I will avoid tutorial binge-watching without practice.
- I will build and break things, then debug them.
- I will document everything I learn in short notes.
- I will focus on finishing projects, not chasing tools.

---

## 10) What I’ll Show Publicly
By Day 90, my GitHub will have:
- 1 complete DevOps project repo with README + architecture diagram
- CI/CD pipeline code
- Kubernetes manifests
- Cloud deployment steps + screenshots/logs
