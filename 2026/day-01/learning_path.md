# 90 Days DevOps & Cloud Learning Plan

## Introduction
I am a **working professional from a non-IT background** transitioning into DevOps and Cloud Engineering.  
I am starting this journey with a genuine interest in infrastructure, cloud systems, and how modern applications are built, deployed, and operated in real-world environments.

This 90-day plan is my execution blueprint to move from fundamentals to job-ready DevOps skills through consistent daily practice.

## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is not just a set of tools.  
It is a culture and practice that focuses on collaboration between development and operations, automation of workflows, reliability of systems, and faster delivery of value to users.

Cloud computing provides on-demand infrastructure, scalability, and managed services that enable DevOps practices to work efficiently at scale.
